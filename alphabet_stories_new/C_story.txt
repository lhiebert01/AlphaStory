Title: C - Cookie Caper

Jack and Jill were busy in the kitchen with Mother Jane, baking a batch of delicious cookies. "Crack the eggs carefully," Mother Jane said as Dot the cat leaped up onto the counter to watch. Spot, their playful pup, circled around the floor, his nose twitching with the scent of sweet sugar. "C is for cookie!" Jack giggled as he mixed the batter. 

Once the cookies were cooling, something curious happened. "Where did the cookies go?" Jill wondered aloud, noticing a few were missing. "Let's be cookie detectives!" Jack exclaimed. They followed a trail of crumbs leading to the closet. Inside, they discovered a cute little mouse nibbling on a cookie. "Oh, you must be hungry!" Jill said with a smile. Instead of being upset, they decided to share their cookies. "C is for caring," Jack added.

With happy hearts and crumbs all around, the children learned how C can create cozy connections. "C is for Cookie, Cat, Counter, Crumbs, and Closet!" they cheered, grateful for their new friend.
