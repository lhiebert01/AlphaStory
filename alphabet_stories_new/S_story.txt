**Title: S - Sleepover Surprise**

Jill was super excited! Her friend Suzy was coming over for a special sleepover. In the living room, they used soft sheets and squishy pillows to build a splendid fort. "This is a special space just for us," giggled Jill. Suzy nodded, her eyes shining with joy.

Jack, Jill's brother, watched curiously. "Can I join?" he asked. "Sorry, it's just for girls," said Jill. But Father Bill had an idea. "Let's set up a space for you, Jack," he suggested, and soon Jack had his own snuggly spot with Spot, the family dog, by his side.

Mother Jane brought a surpriseâ€”a basket filled with scrumptious snacks! Everyone gathered around to share silly stories. Later, when all was still, Dot, the mischievous cat, snuck into the girls' fort. "Eek!" squealed Suzy, "What a surprise!" They all giggled under the starlit sheets.

As the night grew sleepy and serene, they whispered, "S is for Sleepover, Special, Sheets, Stories, and Snacks!"
