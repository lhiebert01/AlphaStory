Title: W - Winter Wonderland

Jack and Jill woke up to find their world turned into a Winter Wonderland! "Wow, look at the snow!" Jill exclaimed. They bundled up in their warmest coats, ready to explore. Outside, the ground was covered in a wide blanket of snow. "Let's make a snowman!" Jack suggested. With Father Bill's help, they rolled big snowballs and made a wide snowman with a wacky carrot nose. "He looks wonderful!" Jack laughed.

Their friends, Johnny and Suzy, joined them for a wild snowball fight. Snowballs whizzed through the air, and everyone giggled and squealed. Spot, their playful dog, was willing to join in the fun, running and rolling in the snow. Dot, the cat, watched from the windowsill, not at all willing to step into the cold.

After a while, they decided to wander into the woods behind their house. "Look, animal tracks!" Jill pointed out. They wondered which animals had walked there. When they went inside, Mother Jane had hot chocolate with whipped cream waiting. "What a wonderful day!" Jack sighed contentedly. 

"W is for Winter, Wonderland, Wide, and Wild!"
