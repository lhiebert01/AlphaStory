Title: B - Beach Ball Bonanza

Jack and Jill jumped with joy as they arrived at the beach with their parents, Bill and Jane. Spot the dog barked happily, while Dot the cat watched curiously. They brought a big blue beach ball, bouncing it all the way to the sand. "Let's play!" Jack cheered.

As they played, a gentle breeze began to blow. "Oh no!" cried Jill, watching the beach ball bounce away. "Let's find our ball!" said Bill with a smile. Off they went, searching along the sunlit shore.

While looking, they built a brilliant sandcastle. "Look at this beautiful butterfly!" Dot meowed, pointing with her paw. Just then, Spot barked excitedly. There, bobbing in the shallow water, was the beach ball! "Hooray!" everyone cheered. They all gathered around, laughing and playing with their blue beach ball once more. What a bonanza of a beach day it was! And they learned that B is for Beach, Ball, Breeze, Butterfly, and Build!
