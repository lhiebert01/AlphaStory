The zoo was a wonderland of surprises. Jack pointed excitedly, "Look, Jill, it's a zebra with zigzag stripes!" The zebras grazed quietly, while nearby, a lazy lion snoozed under the warm sun, his gentle snores sounding like soft zzzs. The zippy monkeys swung from branch to branch, making Jill laugh and clap. "They're so fast!" she exclaimed. Though Spot, their dog, stayed home, Jack whispered, "We'll tell Spot all about our amazing day."

By the time they returned home, even their zestful energy had faded. At dinner, Jill yawned, and Jack rubbed his sleepy eyes. "I'm ready for bed," he mumbled. As they snuggled under their blankets, dreaming of zebras and zippy monkeys, their cat Dot curled up beside them, purring gently. Soon, the room was filled with the soft sound of zzzs. Z is for Zoo, Zebra, Zestful, Zippy, and Zzzs!

Questions:
1. What animals did Jack and Jill see at the zoo?
2. How did the monkeys make Jill feel?
3. Can you make a zzz sound like the sleeping lion?
