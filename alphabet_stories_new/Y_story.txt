**Title: Y - Yummy Yard Picnic**

Jack and Jill were so excited for their yellow-themed picnic! "Let's make everything yellow and yummy!" Jack exclaimed. Mother Jane helped them prepare delicious yellow foods: corn on the cob, cheese sandwiches, lemonade, and banana pudding. "This will be the best picnic ever!" Jill giggled as they spread a bright yellow blanket on the grass in their yard.

Their friends soon arrived, and Spot, the dog, sat patiently, yearning for a taste of the treats. "Good boy, Spot! Maybe you'll get a snack later," Jack promised. Dot, the cat, stretched out under the sun, letting out a big yawn. "Dot loves the sunshine," Jill said with a smile.

After munching on their yellow delights, the children played yard games like tag and hide-and-seek, filling the air with laughter. As the sun began to set, Father Bill brought out yellow glow sticks. "Wow, it's magical!" Jill said as they twirled their glowing treasures. The yard twinkled with yellow light, making the picnic feel like a special adventure. "Y is for all the yummy and yellow things we enjoyed today!" Jack declared with joy.
