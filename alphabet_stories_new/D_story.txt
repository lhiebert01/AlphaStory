**Title: D - Dino Discovery**

In the dusty attic, Jack and Jill found an old dinosaur book. "Look, Jill!" Jack exclaimed, brushing off the dust. Dot the cat purred softly as she dozed nearby, dreaming of dinosaur adventures. As they flipped through pages filled with dinosaurs like Diplodocus and Deinonychus, their imaginations danced.

Meanwhile, in the garden, Spot the dog was busy digging. "Woof! Woof!" he barked, uncovering something big and bony. "It looks like a dinosaur bone!" Jill shouted with delight. Father Bill joined them. "What a discovery! Let's make a display for it," he suggested. They gathered around, planning how to transform their backyard into a prehistoric landscape.

Jack's friend Johnny soon joined the fun. "Let's pretend we're dinosaurs!" Johnny said, stomping around like a dinosaur. "Rawr!" they all roared, pretending to be daring dinosaurs. Through their play, they learned about different dinosaurs and how delightful the letter D is.

"D is for Dinosaur, Discovery, Dusty, Dig, and Display!" they cheered, ending their dinosaur day with a happy dance.
