Title: N - Noisy Neighbors

Jack and Jill were curious about their New neighbors. When Nina and Noah moved in next door, the whole neighborhood was filled with Noise! Bang, clang, toot, and strum—Nina loved her drums, and Noah played the trumpet like a bouncy elephant. Jack and Jill's dog, Spot, barked Nervously at the sounds, while their cat, Dot, hid under the sofa.

“Why don’t we join them?” Jack suggested with a grin. “Yes, let’s make some music too!” Jill agreed. They grabbed their Nice tambourines and maracas, and with a little courage, joined Nina and Noah in the backyard. Father Bill even brought out his old guitar, strumming a happy tune. Mother Jane appeared, smiling, with a tray of lemonade and snacks for the little band.

“We’re the Neighborhood Noise Band!” giggled Nina. Together, they played a joyful melody, filling the air with laughter and song. Spot wagged his tail to the beat, and Dot peeked out, tapping her paws. It was the start of a magical friendship. “N is for Neighbors, New, Noise, Nervous, and Nice!” cheered Jill, as they all enjoyed the lovely afternoon.

Questions:

2. How did Spot and Dot feel about the noisy music at first?
