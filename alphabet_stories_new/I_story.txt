**Title: I - Ice Cream Invention**

Once upon a time, Jack and Jill decided to make their own *Ice cream* with Mother Jane. "Let's invent incredible flavors!" Jack exclaimed. Jill giggled, "How about *Incredible Rainbow*?" Spot, the dog, looked very *Interested* as they tossed colorful candies into the mix. Dot, the cat, yawned and ignored the commotion, lounging on the windowsill.

Mother Jane smiled, "Let's try *Island Coconut* next!" They mixed creamy coconut with tiny pineapple pieces. As the ice cream churned, Dot sniffed the air, her curiosity piqued. Just then, Jack accidentally mixed all the flavors together. "Oh no!" he gasped, but when they tasted it, everyone cheered. "It's *Imagination Ice Cream*!" Jill declared with glee. 

Their friends Johnny and Suzy came over to try the *Invention*. "This is incredible!" said Johnny. Suzy nodded, "It tastes like everything wonderful!" Mother Jane laughed, "I think we've learned something special today." And everyone agreed, "I is for Ice cream, Invention, Incredible, and Imagination!"
